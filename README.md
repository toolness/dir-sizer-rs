[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/dir-sizer-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/toolness/dir-sizer-rs)

This is a simple Rust program that generates information about
the directories taking up lots of space on your system.

It generates two CSV files as output:

* `dirs.csv` is both a form of output, and a cache. It lists *all*
  directories and their sizes. You can interrupt the data collection
  process and the program will pick up where it left off by using this
  CSV file as a cache.

* `big_dirs.csv` only lists directories whose contents are at least
  a certain size.

## Motivation

I'm sure there are tools that do the same thing faster and/or in a
more user-friendly manner, but I needed an excuse to brush up on my
Rust skills.
